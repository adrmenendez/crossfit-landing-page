# CrossFit landing page

This is a simple cossfit landing page project that I'm developing just for learning the fundamentals of zurb foundation. (Still in progress!)

### How to start the project

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```
